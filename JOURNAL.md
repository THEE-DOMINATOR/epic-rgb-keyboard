## 10/8/2025 - Created the KiCad  

Didn't have much time to do much today, so I just created the KiCad project and pushed the init commit to the repo. This is really all I did and now I'm just writing to post to the journal because for some reason you need two hundred and fifty characters to post an update! ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAwNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fbe3f56bc08c941de03a781369a5a0fbd45eb5e4/image.png)
