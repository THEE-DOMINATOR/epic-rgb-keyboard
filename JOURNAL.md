## 10/7/2025 - Created the KiCad  

Didn't have much time to do much today, so I just created the KiCad project and pushed the init commit to the repo. This is really all I did and now I'm just writing to post to the journal because for some reason you need two hundred and fifty characters to post an update! ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAwNCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fbe3f56bc08c941de03a781369a5a0fbd45eb5e4/image.png)
  

## 10/12/2025 11:24 PM - Found the KiCad footprints for the RP2354B  

After hours, and even days of searching, I have found it. 

I have found the KiCad library for the latest Raspberry Pi microcontrollers!

This will save me countless hours because I don't need to make it myself! Also I found the Radio Module 2 also from Raspberry Pi to allow wireless connection between my laptop and keeb!

## 10/12/2025 11:32 PM - Also found the Radio Module 2 footprint!  

I also found the Radio Module 2 footprint! Just figured I should add it in. Now I just need to yap about this for another two hundred twenty characters approximately or so to be able to actually post this through the blueprint graphical user interface!

## 10/16/2025 - Added all the keys to the schematic  

I added all of the letter and symbol keys to the schematic! While I didn't have time to wire them, nor have I added the numerical pad yet, this is major progress! I may add a hackpad into this keyboard if all goes well! It's all contingent on how I balance this with homework...

## 10/18/2025 - Rearranged and finished adding all the keys to the schematic  

I used an image overlay of a logitech keyboard to arrange the keys on my own keyboard! I also added the buttons for the integrated macropad. I'm still working on where I will place the LEDs, it all depends on what keys I go with and what their footprint is.
